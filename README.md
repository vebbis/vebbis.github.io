This repository (and partly this note : -)) was developed using a "Human-in-the-loop" approach with Google Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro). I acted as the architect and lead editor, directing the AI agent to generate the boilerplate and structure, while I manually handled the system design, content creation, and fine-tuning.
